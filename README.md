This is a landing page for a coding accelerator. It's built with modern frontend tools and has a bunch of animations, including a trippy animated background using React Three Fiber. The design uses glassmorphism everywhere, so it looks kinda fancy.

Got some debugging help from AI (Gemini) and used it to help/guide me to create some components.
